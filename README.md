# Yak-Hax
Proves that no social media application is resistant to basic automated tools or bots, and proves as well how easy it is the reverse engineer something as popular as Yik-Yak

##L33t H4x
==============
Yak-Hax is designed to be the succesor to Hack-Yak and pYak, both outdated documentation on the Yik-Yak API. While well documented
it is outdated in that even the base URLs have not been updated. Yak-Hax is written in Java and powered by Maven, and depends on JSoup,
a greate library to easily make GET/POST requests.

##Why not Python?
==============
Despite the fact both previous apis were based on Python, I personally do not enjoy working with Python, however feel free to
use the documentation on the network protocol to port the api to a language of your choosing.
